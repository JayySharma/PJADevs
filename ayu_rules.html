                    Jordan Peterson may be the only clinical psychologist who believes that<br>psychology is 
                    subordinate to philosophy and the one thing that psychology<br>and philosophy both genuflect before is story.
                    Story, or myth, predates<br>religion and is, in fact, as old as language itself.
                    <br><br>
                    In his earlier book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, Peterson<br>connects the stories we share 
                    with our earliest ancestors with modern<br>knowledge of behavior and the mind. 
                    It’s a textbook for his popular<br>University of Toronto courses.
                    <br><br>
                    The one-time dish washer and mill worker spent nearly 20 years at the<br>University before garnering 
                    international attention. In September 2016,<br>Peterson released a couple of videos opposing an amendment to the<br> 
                    Canadian Human Rights Act which he contended could send someone to jail<br>for refusing to use a made-up gender
                    identity pronoun. Peterson went on to<br>testify before the Canadian Senate, and has emerged
                    as a foremost critic of<br>postmodernism on North American campuses.
                    <br><br>
                    Postmodernism is the “new skin of communism,” In Peterson’s view. The<br>ideology has been so thoroughly
                    discredited from an economic standpoint<br>that those who still advocate for it, for either political or 
                    emotional reasons,<br>have resorted to attacking the very process in which something can be<br>discredited—reason 
                    and debate. At the same time they have worked to<br>change the face of oppression away from those living in poverty toward<br>
                    individuals who don’t look or act like those who hold most of the positions<br>of power and authority in Western society.
                    <br><br>
                    Peterson’s classroom is now the entire globe. Millions are watching his<br>lectures and other videos on YouTube. 
                    For this new and greater audience, a<br>more accessible, more affordable compendium than Maps of Meaning was<br>called for.
                    <br><br>
                    12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos is more affordable for sure, but only<br>slightly more accessible. Part self-help 
                    book, part memoir, part Maps for the<br>masses, it’s organized sprawlingly.
